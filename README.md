## Overview

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Initially, the HTML and CSS were done barebones with an eye towards converting this by using the Astro framework. Then, I applied BEM methodology to the CSS. The JS was last.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties with BEM methodology
- Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Some parts, like the navigation bar, I learned from YouTuber Coding2Go and customized it, some from DuckDuckGo's AI when I searched for something. Those parts can be seen along with the comments in the source code.

### Continued development

Might try translating this using a JS framework like Astro in the not too distant future.
